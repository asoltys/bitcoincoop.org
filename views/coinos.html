      <b>COMING SOON:</b><br>
      Although many merchants wish to keep or spend their bitcoin takings, some choose to cash-out all or part into local fiat currency.
      In order to make this a simple and seamless process, we have partnered with local bitcoin exchange Quadriga CX to offer immediate reconciliation to Canadian or US dollars at the moment of sale.
      Please check back soon for more information on this feature.
