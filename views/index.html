    <h3><i class="icon-question-sign"></i> About Us</h3>
    <p>The Bitcoin Co-op was established in 2012 by regular attendees of the Bitcoin Vancouver Meetup group.  As a registered co-operative association in the province of British Columbia, we have an open membership structure and adhere to the <a href="http://bcca.coop/content/principles">Co-op Principles</a>.  Members can attend our meetings, vote on resolutions, participate in elections of our board of directors and have a say in how we prioritize our projects and manage our finances.  Come to our next meeting or event to get to know us and learn how you can get involved!</p>
